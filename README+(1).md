## General Information
- General information about your project: This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. You will need to submit a Jupyter notebook for the same. 
- Dataset: Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- A Multiple Linear Regression model was created.
